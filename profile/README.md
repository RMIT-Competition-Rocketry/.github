## About Us

Formed in 2024 to compete in the Australian Universities Rocket Competition (AURC), RMIT's competition rocket team was built from the ground up by a group of almost 30 engineering students with next to no experience in rocketry.

We have since continued our endeavours in rocketry, expanding to compete in the 2025 International Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC) alongside the AURC once again, entering with our follow up to the Aurora series - **Legacy**<br>
